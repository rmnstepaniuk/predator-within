# Predator Within

**Predator Within** is a simple indie *shoot & run* game

You play as a hunter trying to survive and running from a pack of wolves.
But there is a nuance. To survive you have to kill every predator that's hunting you.
Thus, you unleash the predator that have been hiding in your self.

You will encounter different prey on your path, but if you want to win, you have to be the last one standing

This game has been developed using Java JFrame by a one-man studio aka Computer Sciences student.
